803A5034 - 80388B60 = 1C4D4: offset of the JAL for warp out from the start of player overlay

00BCDB70: vrom start of the player overlay

00BCDB70 + 1C4D4 = BEA044
(vrom start of player overlay + offset of the instruction we want ot modify)

803A6194 - functinon call to spawn warp actor. nopping this works but link is invisible

JAL	0x80024280 - related to making link visible

variable in links actor 
link+0x115

^this never becomes 1 because the warp actor isnt loaded

table entry 800E96B0

link+0x840
801DB270
timer for when to start drawing link during warp in
something checks if this value is 0 at some point to start his draw 

28 getswritten to the timer at 803A616C

link+134 draw function pointer
function 803A8AD0 writes 803A1020 to link+134 when he appears
nopping the jump to the above function (803A60F8) results in a similar invisible link, but you have control

---

this function (803A60A8) uses the timer at link+0x840 to start drawing link
setting the timer to 0 at the start of a normal warp makes him appear asap

if this function isnt called when actor 8c is unloaded, then need to figure out how to make it do that

link state flags 801DB09C

nopping 803A6198 (player_actor+1D638)(function call to spawn actor 8c) will kill the cs but link is invisbile and frozen
writing 803A1020 to 801DAB64 will make him visible but frozen
writing 803975EC to 801DB094 will make him idle but not controlable
