# Better OoT


This is a ROM patcher for _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_ that applies various quality-of-life changes to the game. These changes are implemented with various speedrun categories in mind.



This is an extension of an idea initially created by Moltov. Moltovs original version can be found in the OoT discord https://discord.gg/7FYGh3d 

This project is based on the 3.0 version of the Ocarina of Time randomizer by AmazingAmpharos which can be found here: https://github.com/AmazingAmpharos/OoT-Randomizer



(the readme will be expanded as the project gets closer to being ready for release)
